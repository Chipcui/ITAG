exec "$@"

# This script does nothing but pass its arguments straight through to
# whatever invokes it.  Its purpose is mostly to ensure the correct
# running environment (PERL5LIB, etc) for perl one-liners that the ITAG
# pipeline invokes on cluster nodes, but it can be used to ensure a
# running environment for anything.

# On a production system, this script will be installed in the same
# Shipwright vessel/Debian package as the other ITAG scripts, and
# Shipwright will ensure that it shares their same running environment.

# On a development system, this script will be a no-op.
